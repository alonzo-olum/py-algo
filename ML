ML
machine learning a research discipline at the intersection of statistics, a.i and computer science,
is about extracting knowledge from data.
It is also known as predictive/statistical learning.

Outside of commercial applications,
ml has had a tremendous influence on the way data driven research is done.

- Supervised Learning: thesse are ml algorithms that automate decision making processes by generalizing from known examples.
More generally the user provides the algorithm with pairs of inputs & desired outputs, so that the algorithm finds a way to produce the desired output.
The the algorithm is able to create an output for an input it has never seen before without the help from a human.
Machine learning algorithms that learn from input-output pairs are called supervised learning.
	- identifying ZIP code from handwritten digits on envelope
	- determining whether a tumour is benign based on a medical scan
	- detecting fraudulent credit card transactions

This is in-contrast with another form of learning known as unsupervised algorithms,
where the outputs are unknown. Its examples include; 
	- identifying topics in a blog
	- segmenting customer preferences
	- detecting abnormal activity in a website
